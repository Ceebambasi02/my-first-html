    <p>Some Central American farmers who produce the delicate arabica beans for the world's finest grounds are giving
        up, becoming part of a broader migrant flow to the US-Mexico border</p>


    <p>The four sons of María Bonilla and Esteban Funes all embarked on the treacherous journey north, one of them aged
        10, preferring the life of an unauthorized migrant in America to a coffee farmer in Central America.

    <p>“If I didn’t have my mom, I would also go to the US. It’s better there. Here, no one is solvent,” said
        40-year-old Bonilla, who’s still trying to beat the odds and turn a profit at her family farm in El Laurel,
        northeast Honduras.
